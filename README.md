This is the code repository for [Cloud-Native Applications in Java](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cloud-native-applications-java?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787124349), published by Packt.

**Highly available microservice-based web apps for Cloud with Java**

## What is this book about?
Businesses today are evolving so rapidly that they are resorting to the elasticity of the cloud to provide a platform to build and deploy their highly scalable applications. This means developers now are faced with the challenge of building build applications that are native to the cloud. For this, they need to be aware of the environment, tools, and resources theyâ€™re coding against.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* See the benefits of the cloud environment when it comes to variability, provisioning, and tooling support 
* Understand the architecture patterns and considerations when developing on the cloud 
* Find out how to perform cloud-native techniques/patterns for request routing, RESTful service creation, Event Sourcing, and more 
* Create Docker containers for microservices and set up continuous integration using Jenkins 
* Monitor and troubleshoot an application deployed in the cloud environment 
Explore tools such as Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and the ELK stack for log aggregation and visualization 
Use AWS and Azure specific tools to design, develop, deploy, and manage applications 
Migrate from monolithic architectures to a cloud native deployment

The code will look like the following:
```
-- Adding a few initial products
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (1, 'Apples', 1) 
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (2, 'Oranges', 1) 
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (3, 'Bananas', 1) 
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (4, 'Carrot', 2) 
```
